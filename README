GSvit is a suite of software for FDTD use on CPU and graphics cards,
originally focused on rough surface scattering, solar cell efficiency
calculations and Scanning Near-Field Optical microscopy image simulations.

On systems where it is possible (e.g. Linux), GSvit is installed 
using standard "./configure; make; make install" approach
as many other applications. See generic information in 'INSTALL' file.
 

Right now, only computational core is provided (gsvit) that will be followed
by different GUI frontends and backends for different applications.
GSvit optionally uses package "Gwyddion" for output and input data treatment.
If computation on graphics cards is requested, NVIDIA CUDA environment is used.
A path to these two packages may need to be supplied if they are not in
a default location, e.g. like this:

./autogen.sh --prefix=/home/klapetek/runsvit --with-gwyddion=/home/klapetek/run2
./autogen.sh --prefix=/home/klapetek/runsvit --with-cuda=/usr/local/cuda --with-gwyddion=/home/klapetek/run2

Note that it is necessary to have LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable pointing also to directory
where the Gwyddion libraries are located, so if it is in non-default location as in above example,
you may need to add to your .bashrc file lines:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/klapetek/run2/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH 

GSvit is cross-built for Windows as well using a mingw32 gcc compiler. To date only the 32-bit binary is created.
