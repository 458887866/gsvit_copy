test01: basic operation

Cubic volume with no boundary conditions (i.e. not precise reflecting BC),
and centered point source. Outputs different cross-section planes to Gwyddion file
and to a text file (from single point).
Calculation is performed on CPU and material (which is none) is checked
to use faster variant of Yee algorithm.

What can be tested:
- basic performance of the software (first test to see whether it works after installation)
- performance of Yee algorithm with none material properties (compare with MATMODE_CHECK=0 calling
full algorithm, resulting in different speed and memory allocation.)
- GPU performance (compare with GPU=1)
- GPU performance with none/full material properties (combine GPU and MATMODE)
- scaling of basic calculation speed and memory requirements (varying POOL size)
- point source properties (varying the file "xsource.txt").

Compare out.gwy with test01_out.gwy or point_log with test01_point_log to check 
proper performance.

test02: total/scattered field source

Cubic volume with Liao absorbing boundary condition and Total/scattered field plane wave
source. Outputs cross-sections to a Gwyddion file and point values in three different
locations in scattered field region to text files. A perfect electric conductor (PEC)
sphere is located in the center.

What can be tested:
- performance of boundary conditions
- use of TSF source (try different angles for incident wave)
- PEC material conditions
- try using real metal instead of PEC

Compare out.gwy with test02_out.gwy or tpntx with test02_pointx_log (and similarily
for tpnty and tpntz) to check proper performance. Results should be directly comparable
with test03 (SF source).

test03: scattered field source

Cubic volume with Liao absorbing boundary condition and Scattered field plane wave
source. Outputs cross-sections to a Gwyddion file and point values in three different
locations in scattered field region to text files. A perfect electric conductor (PEC)
sphere is located in the center.

What can be tested:
- performance of boundary conditions
- use of SF source (try different angles for incident wave)
- PEC material conditions

Compare out.gwy with test03_out.gwy or tpntx with test03_pointx_log (and similarily
for tpnty and tpntz) to check proper performance. Results should be directly comparable
with test02 (TSF source).

test04: near-to far field transformation

Cubic volume with Liao absorbing boundary condition and a point source. 
Near-to-far field transformation (NFFF) is applied to calculate values of electric field 
in single point in a computation space, being directly comparable with direct
computation.

What can be tested:
- NFFF operation, try different NFFF integration boundary sizes and shapes

Compare out.gwy with test04_out.gwy, xpnt with test01_point_log to check
proper performance.

test05: convolutional perfectly matched layer

Cubic volume with Convolutional Perfectly Matched Layer boundary condition and a point source. 

What can be tested:
- compare performance of different CPML settings
- compare performance of Liao boundary condition (modify paramtere BOUNDARY_ALL to liao)
- try to add material to the computational volume, including boundaries, as
MEDIUM_VECTOR
halfspace.txt

Compare out.gwy with test05_out.gwy and xpnt with test05_point_log to check
proper performance.

test06: periodic boundary conditions

Cubic volume with Liao boundary condition, a point source and medium periodic boundary
condition creating a periodic cube within the computational volume. 

What can be tested:
- medium periodic boundary conditions

Compare out.gwy with test06_out.gwy and xpnt with test06_point_log to check
proper performance.
